HandsOn Greater Phoenix is a local nonprofit whose mission is to put volunteers to work where they are needed most.  We are partnering with ASU and other local partners at both Phoenix Municipal Stadium and State Farm Stadium to register and schedule volunteers to staff the vaccine sites. The engine for these sites running smoothly, is the volunteer workforce running them!
With that in mind, our job is not to get individual volunteers personally vaccinated (that is a volunteer benefit), our job is to help coordinate mass volunteer staffing so that ALL Arizonans have the opportunity to be vaccinated.  So we ask for your help and your patience to support this months-long effort.   
We hear you!  We know that our site slows down when we release new shifts. There are thousands of you trying to get these volunteer slots. But with every release, we are making improvements and are committed to a better and better experience as we move forward.  We hope you will work with us in this effort to stay focused on the bigger pictures and not our own individual agendas.
 

Updated March 10, 2021 
Good afternoon!  Our volunteer shifts are currently full through March 23rd at Phoenix Municipal and through March 16th at State Farm.  We are releasing new dates later this week for State Farm ONLY through March 25th.  We will be releasing new dates for the remainder of March at Phoenix Municipal next week.  Cancellations do occasionally happen- you are welcome to check our site between releases.
NOTE: Photo IDs are now required at volunteer check-in.
 
New system update as of 3/1/2021. Volunteer shifts will only appear if there are volunteer spots available. If you do not see any shifts to sign up for that means all spots are currently full.
Make sure to read through our Volunteer FAQ page for more information and answers to commonly asked questions.
